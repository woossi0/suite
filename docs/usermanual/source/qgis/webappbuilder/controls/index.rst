.. todo:: ADD CON FIGURE AND DESCRIPTION

There are two options for defining bookmarks:

* Using QGIS bookmarks. Click :guilabel:`Add from QGIS bookmarks` and in the dialog that will appear, select the bookmarks to use from the ones currently stored in the QGIS database. Since those bookmarks do not contain a description, but just name and extent, you should define the description manually, typing it in the :guilabel:`Description` box for each bookmark.

* Using a vector layer. A new bookmark will be added for each feature in the layer, using the bounding box of the feature geometry as the bookmark extent. The name and description of each bookmark will be taken from two attributes in the layer.

The :guilabel:`Configuration tab` controls how the bookmarks will be displayed. If the :guilabel:`Show as story panel` box is checked, a narrative map will be created, and a panel to browse across bookmarks will be added to the web app. Otherwise, bookmarks will be shown as menu entries in the navigation bar, under a :guilabel:`Bookmarks` menu.
