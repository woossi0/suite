Setting up Tomcat Manager
=========================

.. note::

   This section only applies to the following versions of OpenGeo Suite:

   * OpenGeo Suite for Ubuntu Linux
   * OpenGeo Suite for Red Hat Linux
   * OpenGeo Suite for Application Servers (when using **Tomcat**).

   OpenGeo Suite for Windows and OS X use `Jetty <http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/>`_, not Tomcat.

`Apache Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org>`_ is the application server used on Linux-based installations of OpenGeo Suite. While Apache Tomcat has a graphical manager for loading and managing web applications, **the Tomcat Manager is not loaded with OpenGeo Suite by default**.

This section will show you how to install the Tomcat Manager.

Installing via package manager
------------------------------

Ubuntu Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Tomcat Manager can be installed with the ``tomcat6-admin`` package through the standard Ubuntu package manager.

#. In a terminal, enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      sudo apt-get install tomcat6-admin

#. Restart Tomcat:

   .. code-block:: console

      sudo service tomcat6 restart

#. To verify that the package was installed correctly, navigate to ``http://localhost:8080/manager`` (or substitute the location of the root web application URL) and you will see a request for credentials:

#. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` for now.

#. Continue below at the :ref:`sysadmin.manager.access` section.

Red Hat-based Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Tomcat Manager can be installed with the ``tomcat-host-manager`` package through the standard Red Hat package manager.

#. In a terminal, enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      sudo yum install tomcat-host-manager

#. Restart Tomcat:

   .. code-block:: console

      sudo service tomcat6 restart

#. To verify that the package was installed correctly, navigate to ``http://localhost:8080/manager`` (or substitute the location of the root web application URL) and you will see a request for credentials.

#. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` for now.

#. Continue below at the :ref:`sysadmin.manager.access` section.

.. _sysadmin.manager.access:

Allowing access to Tomcat Manager
---------------------------------

To access Tomcat Manager, you will need to create a user in Tomcat with the credentials to access it. The simplest way to create a user in Tomcat is as follows:

#. Open :file:`tomcat-users.xml` (typically found in :file:`/etc/tomcat6`) in a text editor.

#. In the ``<tomcat-users>`` block, add the following line:

   .. code-block:: xml

     <user username="admin" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/> 

   This will create a user with the name of ``admin`` and a password of ``tomcat``. Feel free to substitute your own credentials.

   .. note:: Make sure this line is not inside a block that is commented out, otherwise it will have no effect. 

#. Save and close the file.

#. Restart Tomcat.

#. Navigate back to ``http://localhost:8080/manager`` and verify that the credentials allow access to Tomcat Manager.
