PostGIS.app
^^^^^^^^^^^

On Mac PostGIS ships as a self contained application. Start by double-clicking 
:guilabel:`PostGIS.app``. You will see a "Welcome" window the first time the 
application is launched.

You can check the PostgreSQL server status and perform other tasks from the 
PostGIS icon in the OSX menu bar.

.. note:: While it is possible to run the PostGIS application directly from the installer disk image it is recommended you first copy it to :file:`/Applications` and run from there. 

GeoServer.app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Mac GeoServer ships as a self contained application. Start by double-clicking
:guilabel:`GeoServer.app`. You will see a "Welcome" window the first time the 
application is launched.

.. note:: The GeoServer application runs a Jetty web server that also contains GeoWebCache, GeoExplorer, and the OpenGeo dashboard.

You can check the server status and perform other tasks from the GeoServer icon
in the OSX menu bar.

Once the server has fully started up a web browser will open and display the

.. note:: While it is possible to run the GeoServer application directly from the installer disk image it is recommended you first copy it to :file:`/Applications` and run from there. 

CLI tools
^^^^^^^^^

The CLI tools package contains all the command line tools for OpenGeo Suite:

* The PostGIS data conversion utilities such as ``shp2pgsql``
* The `GDAL/OGR <http://www.gdal.org/>`_ format translation utilities
* The `PDAL <http://www.pointcloud.org/>`_ tools for working with LIDAR point cloud data

Start by double-clicking the :guilabel:`OpenGeo CLI Tools.pkg` file.

   OpenGeo Suite Command Line Tools Installer

Work through the installer windows accepting the defaults. 

The CLI tools package installs everything into :file:`/usr/local/opengeo`. This
directory must be added to the ``PATH``. Add the following line to your 
``.profile``::

  export PATH=/usr/local/opengeo/bin:$PATH

.. note:: Alternatively you can run the :file:`/usr/local/opengeo/bin/opengeo-clitools-doctor` utility which will symlink all the tools into :file:`/usr/local/bin`. Use this method with caution as it may conflict with different versions of the same tools already installed on the system.

PostGIS Utilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PostGIS Utilities package contains utility applications for working with 
PostGIS and PostgreSQL:

* **pgAdmin** - A database manager for PostgreSQL
* **pgShapeLoader** - A graphical Shapefile loader/dumper

To run the applications simply double-click.

.. note:: As with the other applications of OpenGeo Suite it is recommended that you copy them to :file:`/Applications` for subsequent usage.
