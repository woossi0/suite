The :guilabel:`world:volcanoes` layer is derived from the freely available volcano data compiled by the Smithsonian Institute, Global Volcanism Program. The :guilabel:`world:globaldata_temp` layer is derived from the `NASA GLOBE Program <http://www.globe.gov/>`_ and again is freely available. (GLOBE data is only available for locations in countries that have joined the GLOBE Program.) 

The :guilabel:`world:urbanareas1_1` layer was obtained from the `Nordpil world database of large urban areas <http://nordpil.com/go/resources/world-database-of-large-cities/>`_, derived from the World Urbanization Prospects: The 2007 Revision Population Database (UN Population Division). The urban areas data is made available under a Creative Commons public domain license.

The :guilabel:`world:cities` layer was derived from public domain data obtained from the `Natural Earth <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/>`_ website. The :guilabel:`world:borders` layer was downloaded from the `Mapping Hacks <http://www.mappinghacks.com/data>`_ website. The original data was derived from public domain sources.
