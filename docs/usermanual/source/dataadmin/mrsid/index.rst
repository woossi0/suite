.. _dataadmin.mrsid:

Enabling MrSID image support
============================

The Boundless Suite comes with support for publishing data from many formats supported by the `Geospatial Data Abstraction Library <http://gdal.org>`_ (GDAL). These formats include DTED, EHdr, AIG, ENVIHdr, and much more.

`MrSID <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_mrsid.html>`_ is available as an optional extension as well, but due to licensing issues, it is not enabled by default. The steps to enable support will differ depending on how the Boundless Suite is installed, and on what platform.

.. note:: MrSID support is only available with `Boundless Suite Enterprise <http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/>`_. For more information on Boundless Suite Enterprise, please `contact us <http://boundlessgeo.com/about/contact-us/sales/>`_.

Find the method of installation below and continue there.

Installation
------------

Ubuntu
~~~~~~

.. note:: By default, Boundless Suite for Applications Servers (WAR bundle) will not show **any** of the GDAL image formats at all. To enable GDAL image formats in this type of installation, please see the section on :ref:`dataadmin.gdal`. This section assumes that the GDAL image formats are already enabled.

MrSID support is provided by a separate package called **gdal-mrsid**.

#. Install the following package from the OpenGeo repository. (See :ref:`intro.installation.ubuntu.install` for instructions on how to add the OpenGeo repository)::

      apt-get install gdal-mrsid

   .. note::  You must run these commands as root or use :command:`sudo`.

#. Restart Tomcat.
