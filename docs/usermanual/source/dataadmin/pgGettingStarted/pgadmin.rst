Connecting to the PostgreSQL Database
=====================================

There are a number of front-end tools available for connecting to, and working with, the PostgreSQL database. Among the most popular are `psql <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/app-psql.html>`_, a command-line tool for querying the database, and the free and open source graphical tool `pgAdmin <http://www.pgadmin.org/>`_. 

.. note:: Any data querying and manipulation you can do with ``pgAdmin`` can also be done at the command line with ``psql``.


Launching pgAdmin
-----------------

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux pgAdmin can be launched from the terminal with the ``pgadmin3`` command.


Working with pgAdmin
--------------------

As part of the installation of the OpenGeo Suite, you should have one pre-configured PostGIS server, localhost:5432, listed in the pgAdmin :guilabel:`Object browser`.

If you don't have an entry for PostGIS listed, add a new server connection manually. Click :menuselection:`File --> Add Server` and complete the :guilabel:`New Server Registation` dialog box to register a new server. Ensure the Host is set to **localhost** and Port is **5432** (unless you have configured PostgreSQL for a different port).

To connect to the PostGIS server, double-click the PostGIS server item and provide the password when prompted. To view the databases in this instance, expand the :menuselection:`Databases` item. Double-click one of the listed databases to reveal the contents in the :guilabel:`Object browser`.

   *Navigating the database*

When executing SQL queries, make sure you have the intended target database selected.  The SQL :guilabel:`Query` dialog box will confirm the current database selection.
