However, GeoExplorer can connect to and read data from a variety of sources. Refer to the section on :ref:`adding layers <geoexplorer.using.add>` for more information.*What versions of GeoServer can I log in to for editing?*  We recommended you match the version of GeoServer to the version of GeoExplorer. However, if you are using a community version of GeoServer, please ensure that you are working with version GeoServer 2.1.0 or newer.*Can I log in to and edit a remote GeoServer?*  No, only the local GeoServer is supported. GeoServer needs run in the same web application container as GeoExplorer. For example, if your GeoExplorer is at ``http://example.com/geoexplorer``, you will only be able to login to a GeoServer located at ``http://example.com/geoserver``.*How is authentication handled?*  GeoExplorer uses `basic authentication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_.
