.. _geoexplorer.using.style:Layer Styles============GeoExplorer includes an integrated :guilabel:`Styles` editor for layers published by a :term:`WMS` server adopting the :term:`SLD` standard. Authentication is required to edit styles through GeoExplorer. For more information, please see the :ref:`geoexplorer.using.login` section... note:: Not all functionality referenced in the SLD 1.0 specification is available in the Styles editor. For more information on SLD, please see the `OGC specification <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld>`_ and the GeoServer documentation... warning:: Any changes made to styles will be available immediately on the server. In addition, as the SLD will be completely overwritten with each edit, you will loose any comments recorded in the XML document. We recommend you make a backup of your existing SLDs before editing styles in GeoExplorer.The following sections describe how to use the :guilabel:`Styles` editor... toctree::   :hidden:    access   styles   rulesWorking with the Styles editor------------------------------:doc:`Access <access>`  Accessing the Styles editor  :doc:`Styles <styles>`  Adding, removing, editing, and duplicating layer styles:doc:`Rules <rules>`  Adding, deleting, editing, and duplicating layer style rules
